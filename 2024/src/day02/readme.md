## Thought process part 1
1. Have a variable that have the last level number of the report and updated each time that change report
2. Have a condition that mark the report unsafe if the change is less than one or more than 3
3. Have a condition that mark if change from increasing to decreasing in levels
4. Must be able to know when a line end to know when the report end
5. Show the result of safe reports

For(){
tot += left * right[left]
}

## Thought process part 2
1. Make a function that return if a report is safe
2. For each report proving all the possibilities of one level less until prove all or give a safe report

## What I want to improve in the next one
1. Kotlinâ€™s **map**, **filter**, **count**, and **all** wherever applicable. This will make my code more concise and expressive.
2. Practice idioms like **zipWithNext**, **indices**, and working with immutable collections (List instead of ArrayList).
