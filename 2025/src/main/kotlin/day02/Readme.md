## Thought process part 1
1. Get the next invalid Id
2. Check if it's in the range
3. if it's we added to the ans and go to the step 1
4. If two is false, we check the next range
## Problems:
1. Didn't think about having a getLowerAndUpperBound function
## Solution
1. Added to the code

## Thought process part 2
1. Do the same but do a new function base on getNextInvalidId that can take different partitions

## Learnings
1. After doing a solution, love telling AI to put comments, would be easier to come back in a year
2. Bigger functions are a no if I want to keep brute forcing, easier to catch the issue through testing if it's less tha 40 lines
