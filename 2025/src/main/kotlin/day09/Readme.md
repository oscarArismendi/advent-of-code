## Thought process part 1
1. Calculate the area between points
2. Sort the list in descending order (Could be more efficient, but I feel it could be handy for part 2)
## Thought process part 2
1. Don't want to just brute force it by doing a matrix with all the valid green and red tiles and then pass through it to see if the area is valid
## Problems
1. Time complexity
## Solution
1. To be found :,(

## Learnings
1. Need to make a course of graphs
2. To solve part two let's begin by learning ray-casting
