## Thought process part 2
1. Need to convert problems to cephalopod notation
## Problems
1. Whitespaces
2. IntelliJ delete trailing spaces

1. Using regex to detect them
2. Go to **File** > **Settings** (or **IntelliJ IDEA** > **Preferences** on macOS)
   - Go to **File** > **Settings**
   - Navigate to **Editor** > **General**
   - Find the option **Strip trailing spaces on Save** and change it from "All" to "None"
   - Click **Apply** and **OK**

1. Sometimes the problem is the IDE
2. Should have dedicate more thought to transpose the matrix
