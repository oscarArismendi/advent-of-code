## Thought process part 1
1. The variable will start at 50, and after we do the substraction
2. if it's less than 0 we do 100 + var
3. if it's more than 99 we do 100 - var
4. After each rotation we see if it's equal to 0 and added to the answer
## Problems:
1. When the value is more than 100
## Solution
1. Do the module of 100 for the value of the rotation
